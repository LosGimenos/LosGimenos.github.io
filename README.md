## How's it going?
Full stack developer with a drama degree. Based in NYC. Current fav stack includes React, Flask, Webpack, PostgreSQL or Neo4j. Love learning all the things. I'm low-ego, a consensus builder, highly-teachable, and generally know when I'm being the dumb.

## Technologies Used
1. React
2. CSS
3. SASS
4. Webpack
5. BrowserSync 

### The Journey
The first iteration of this was built just with HTML and CSS. In time I decided to build this guy in React. I bought a domain name ('hooray!') but kept the actual hosting here on good ol' free gh-pages. Now when you use a DNS mask you sometimes get your site just thrown into a silly HTML frame. Frames are silly, silly, things and make me want to punch myself in the throat when it comes to responsiveness in mobile. After a few other versions that imlemented SASS, beefed up Webpack a bit, I finally decided just to build a silly emulator that will actually completely mirror the environment that the site thinks it's in when masked. Using that and BrowserSync to throw this into my actual mobile device when testing has kept my no gray hair streak going strong.
